this /Nasal folder is placed on linux systems
in /users/you/.fgfs

on windows systems in a folder called
flightgear.org

and on mac 
users/Library/Application Support/FlightGear

IMPORTAND:: this is NOT the /Nasal folder
in the fgdata or data folder


since Flightgear 3.7 you must set the Nasal folder as executable like this for example:

--fg-aircraft=/home/yourdirectory/.fgfs/Custom/Scenery/Motorcycle-fg-CustomScenery/Nasal/
